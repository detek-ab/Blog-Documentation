# Comparison of Open Source Licenses [^1]
  
Open Source Licenses are used to clarify the rules regarding using an [open source project](https://codingnomads.com/what-are-open-source-projects). They provide the terms and conditions that define the extent to which others can modify or share an open source project.

If you have a project idea you want to work on or are considering using an open source project for your own purposes, this lesson provides an overview and comparison of the most common open source license types.

Legal decisions can be tricky sometimes, so this lesson aims to help you find the appropriate license for your project.

Comparison of Open Source Licenses
----------------------------------

In general, software licenses make it clear what others can do with a project's source code. There are several different types of recognized open source licenses that you can apply to your work. Each license has a specific focus, so which one should you choose for your project?

Below is a comparison of open source licenses that are widely used today. Which one you should choose will depend on what you want to achieve, and how your project should be distributed among its users.

If you are just getting started with coding, you can use this information as a reference for when the time comes to choose a license for your projects.

### MIT License

The [MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), lets people do anything they want with a project's source code, as long as they provide attribution back to the author, and don't hold the author responsible if something goes wrong.

To apply the MIT license, you need to include a copyright notice with a copy of the license in the source code.

If someone uses your source code, they don't need to announce doing so publicly. Software modifications can be released under any license, and changes made to the codebase don't need to be documented.

### GNU General Public License (GPL)

The [GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license) is a [copyleft license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft), meaning that any derivative works must be open sourced and distributed under the same license. Therefore, GPL is not ideal for use in proprietary software, where you wish to refrain from sharing the source code with others to use and modify.

The GPL has two versions:

*   GNU General Public License, version 2
*   GNU General Public License, version 3

The main difference between these two lies in the clause on _patent grants_. The clause was added in GPLv3, and is meant to prevent companies from charging users for the use of their patents.

Examples of software that use the GPL are **Joomla** and **Notepad++**.

### GNU Library, or "Lesser" General Public License (LGPL)

The [GNU Library, or "Lesser" General Public License (LGPL)](https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license) is a copyleft license, similar to the GPL, but with fewer copyleft requirements. It allows the software to be used in a proprietary project under certain conditions.

The LGPL is considered a compromise between the strong copyleft licenses like GPL, and the permissive licenses like BSD (see below) or MIT.

### Apache License 2.0

[Apache License 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) is the most modern and balanced among [permissive licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license). It allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute any Apache licensed product.

The Apache License terms state that you don't need to make the source code public when a distribution of the software is made. However, modifications made to the code need to be documented.

Apache-licensed software can be used in commercial projects for free. It does, however, restrict the use of a trademark in the following ways:

*   You can't name your software as if Apache endorsed it
*   You can't use the Apache logo anywhere in your project or documentation

Examples of open source software using the Apache license are **Firebase** and **Swift**.

### Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)

The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) License has two main versions:

*   [BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)
*   [BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" or "FreeBSD" license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)

BSD is a permissive license that allows people to do nearly anything with your code with proper attribution and without warranty. The source code doesn't need to be public when a distribution is made. Changes made in the software can be released without any license.

BSD License allows for code to be used in [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) and proprietary products, as long as the original copyright and license requirement are not violated and fulfilled correctly.

The BSD 3-clause differs from the BSD 2-Clause in that with the BSD 3-Clause, the names of the author and contributors can't be used to promote products modified from the software without having permission.

An example of software using the BSD license is **Django**.

### Mozilla Public License (MPL)

[MPL 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0) is maintained by Mozilla. Its use and restrictions fall between the permissive BSD license and the reciprocal GPL license.

Summary: Open Source Licenses
-----------------------------

Open source licenses are used to make it clear what people can do with the source code of an open source project. There are many different types of recognized open source licenses that you can apply to your work.

This lesson provided a comparison of open source licenses with the goal of helping you navigate which type of open source projects and licensing to use for your projects.
